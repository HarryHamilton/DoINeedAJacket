## TODO list
* Allow user to change the room
* Allow user to set their own minimum temp
* Add daily email function
  * Program will email me on the days I'm in uni with the info
* Add sunglasses feature
  * Tell user whether they need sunglasses depending on the lux of the room
* Give user option to display data depending on room number
  * Important to note that not all rooms have the same sensors, e.g. some might not have CO2 level
* Retrieve outside temperature to say whether you need a jacket for the walk to uni
